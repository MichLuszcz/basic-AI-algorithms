# This is a collection of a couple different AI algorithms I implemented as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class. 
It includes:
- a gradient descent algorithm for minimizing a function, with a 3d graph showing the process of the optimisiation
- a minimax algorithm for playing tic-tac-toe (playable)
- an array of Support Vector Machines used to classify the MNIST dataset
- an evolutionary algorithm aproximating a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem

I also implemented a simple neural net, that project was however rushed so I don't share it here as it's not representative.

## What I learned:
- using different AI algorithms to solve different problems, ones often very difficult ones for humans
- using the numpy library for matrix and vector operations
